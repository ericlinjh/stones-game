There are multiple ways to customize each game of Stones. First you can choose how many players you would like to play with, one or two. Then, you can choose how many starting stones you would like in each pit, between two to five. You can choose any of these options using a drop-down menu.

This is the screen you will be greeted with at the beginning of the game. You can see the number of stones in each pit based on the number in the pit. You can make your move by clicking on the pit you would like to move.

After the first move, the player finished their move by dropping a stone into the home pit. This means that the player can choose another set of stones to move. Added onto the GUI now is a status of the last move, as well as an explanation for why the player gets to move again.

After the player moves again, it's time for the AI to move. The GUI updates once again to show the move that the AI made. The AI does a similar move to the player, dropping it's final stone in the AI home pit. This allows the AI to move again. Once the player is finished reading, they can press the "Next Move" button to see what the AI's next move is.

That's the basic gist of the game, the players will continue to alternate turns until there are no more stones in play.
